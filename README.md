Problem Summary
---------------

The experiments had been conducted with 30 volunteers, aged from 19 to
48, peforming six activies (walking, walking downstairs, walking
upstairs, sitting, laying and standing). By wearing a samrtphone on the
waist, data of 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity
was captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 30% of data from volunteers
was classified as test data and 70% of it as train data.

The Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project requires student to process
the raw data from experiment into a tidy data set containg purely the
mean and standard deviation of each activities from every single
volunteers.
